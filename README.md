politics-hacking
================

This is where I'll store code for data wrangling political 
data online from the web. 

So far, there is only one program, countRussia.py which is 
in the politics module. 

Its usage is described in [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/chrismattmann/208bd08acdfe85d20dcde5d70c1a8906).

Questions, comments?
